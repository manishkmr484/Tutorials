First you need to make sure that your vasp code is complied with VTST Tools 
(https://theory.cm.utexas.edu/vtsttools/download.html). 
Otherwise you can not do a CI-NEB calculation. 


Step 1: You need to have your initial and final structures (optimized)
  

STEP 2: Change Name of the POSCARs: POSCAR1(mens initial geometry) and POSCAR2 (Final geometry). 

STEP 3: Then you use the VTST script nebmake.pl to create the number of images. 
        If you want to have 4 images then you do:

        nebmake.pl POSCAR1 POSCAR2 4 # (4 means 4 images)

STEP 4: After step 3, you will have 6 folder (00,01,02,03,04,05). 
        Here 00 and 05 folders are Initial and Final structures respectively.
		For further analysis you need to put the OUTCARs for POSCAR1 and POSCAR2 in the folders 00 and 05.

STEP 5: Now in your parent directory where you have all the (00,01,02,03,04,05,) directories, 
        now you add your INCAR, KPOINTS and POTCAR file and submit the job. 
		But this time, your INCAR file will be a little be different as you need to include the NEB tags on it. 

A sample of INCAR file is here in the following:
-------------------------------------------------------

NPAR = 8

ISIF = 2                              # Moves ionic positions, if ISIF = 3 moves cell volume and cell shape 
NSW = 4000                            # NSW sets the maximum number of ionic steps.
NELM = 3000                           # NELM sets the maximum number of electronic self-consistency steps
NELMIN = 6                            # NELMIN specifies the minimum number of electronic self-consistency steps
ISYM = 0                              # ISYM= 1 | 2 | 3, switches on the use of symmetry. For ISYM=-1 | 0, the use of symmetry is switched off.
ISPIN = 2                             # ISPIN = 1 Non-Spin polarised DFT, 2-Spin polarised Calculations
IDIPOL = 3                            # IDIPOL switches on monopole/dipole and quadrupole corrections to the total energy

AMIX = 0.2
BMIX = 0.00001
AMIX_MAG = 0.8
BMIX_MAG = 0.00001
LREAL = Auto
PREC = Accurate
EDIFF = 1E-06                         # SCF energy convergence, in eV

ENCUT = 400.0                         # you can find it from POTCAR : ENMAX  =  400.000  (Carbon atom in POTCAR)

####Magnetization####
#LORBIT = 11                           # To get magnetization density
#MAGMOM = 72*0.6                       # MAGMOM Specifies the initial magnetic moment for each atom


###CI-NEB###
NWRITE = 0
IMAGES = 4                           # Number of NEB images between the fixed endpoints  
SPRING = -5                          # Spring force (eV/A2) between images         
ICHAIN = 0                           # Indicates which method to run. NEB (ICHAIN=0) is the default         
LCLIMB = TRUE                        # Flag to turn on the climbing image algorithm
IOPT = 0                             # Default is to use the VASP optimizers


STEP 6: nebef.pl (during the optimization you can use this script to know the energy and foreces of images)


STEP 7: nebresults.pl ( after completion of your calculation: output: nebef.dat, spline.dat, neb.dat, exts.dat, mep.eps, movie.xyz, vaspgr)
